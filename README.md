# What does a computer understand?
Computers help us work faster and more efficiently because they can generate a result to solve our operations from a previously defined set of instructions. In addition, just like in movies, computers have millions of electronic devices that we know as transistors and are in charge of converting electricity into bits: the binary system of zeros and ones, the least expression of information in computers. Of course, the instructions or algorithms of computers improve every day to turn bits into new functionalities and better types of information. Using an algorithm, you can teach your computer a clear way to solve problems without creating ambiguities.
