# What does a computer understand?
Computers help us work faster and more efficiently because they can generate a result to solve our operations from a previously defined set of instructions. In addition, just like in movies, computers have millions of electronic devices that we know as transistors and are in charge of converting electricity into bits: the binary system of zeros and ones, the least expression of information in computers. Of course, the instructions or algorithms of computers improve every day to turn bits into new functionalities and better types of information. Using an algorithm, you can teach your computer a clear way to solve problems without creating ambiguities.

# Programming languages
Programming languages are a set of instructions that we use to teach computers the steps to follow to solve a problem.

There are different types of programming languages and we can reduce them into 2 main categories: low-level and high-level languages. This according to their complexity and level of concern or access to hardware.

**Low-level languages:** They are those that allow you to make modifications to the hardware. The lower the level, the more programmers have to worry about hardware. For example, we have the machine language (only binary code) as the highest level, followed by assembler (with friendlier instructions) and other languages such as C or C ++.

**High-level languages:** They are frequently more modern languages in which one as a programmer focuses on the software, not so much on the hardware. For example, Ruby, JavaScript, or Perl.
